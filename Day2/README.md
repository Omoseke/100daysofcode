# Day 2 of My 100 Days of Code/DevOps Journey: Learning About Maven 

Today, I am diving into Maven, a powerful tool that simplifies building and managing Java projects (though it can be used for other languages as well). Maven helps streamline the entire software development lifecycle and make builds more efficient.

What is Maven?
Maven is an open-source build automation and dependency management tool that uses a configuration file called 'pom.xml' (Project Object Model) to manage project structure, dependencies, and plugins.

Key Features of Maven:
- Dependency Management: Automatically downloads and manages libraries and dependencies. It simplifies adding and updating external libraries in your project.
- Build Automation: Standardizes tasks like compiling code, running tests, generating documentation, and packaging applications into formats like JAR or WAR files.
- Consistency: Follows a standard project layout, making it easier to collaborate and maintain projects.
- Plugin System: Supports custom build steps and integrates with tools like Jenkins, SonarQube, and Docker.

Maven Build Lifecycle:

- Clean Lifecycle: Deletes build outputs from previous builds.
 - mvn clean: Cleans up previous build outputs.

- Default Lifecycle:
 - validate: Checks if all necessary information is available.
 - compile: Compiles the source code.
 - test: Runs unit tests.
 - package: Packages the code into formats like JAR or WAR.
 - install: Installs the package into the local repository.
 - deploy: Deploys the package to a remote repository.

- Site Lifecycle:
 - site: Generates project documentation.
 - site-deploy: Deploys documentation to a remote server.

Benefits of Maven:
- Simplified Setup: Standard project structure makes starting and collaborating easier.
- Automated Dependency Handling: Manages and resolves dependencies automatically.
- Scalability: Efficiently manages large projects with numerous dependencies.
- CI/CD Integration: Enhances speed and reliability in DevOps workflows.

I am excited to see how Maven can enhance the efficiency of the development and deployment processes. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue this journey!
