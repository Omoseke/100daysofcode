# Day 1 of My 100 Days of Code/DevOps Journey: Exploring DevOps & CI/CDÂ ðŸŒŸ

I am excited to dive into the core concepts of DevOps and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
This journey will take me through the entire DevOps lifecycle, from coding to production, exploring how development and operations teams can work together seamlessly.
DevOps Engineering can also be simply put as the processes involved from code to production.
DevOps is more than just a set of toolsâ€Š-â€Šit's a culture that unifies development and operations. Here's how the process flows:
Development: The journey starts with writing and refining the app code.
Operations: This involves everything from building, testing, and securing the code to analyzing, deploying, and managing the application in production.
CI/CD Process: Ensuring Smooth Integration and Deployment.
Continuous Integration (CI): CI allows multiple commits or changes by developers to be integrated into the product without disrupting the main running application. The dev team commits code, the ops team builds it, handles the build process, and reports the resultsâ€Š-â€Škeeping everything in sync and error-free.
Continuous Deployment (CD): CD takes deployment to the next level by automating the process across various environments (e.g., Dev, QA, PPD, Prod, Disaster Recovery) before reaching production. This includes automated deployment, testing, release rollback, and monitoring, ensuring that only the best versions make it to production.
Benefits of DevOps Processes.
Speed: Time saved with faster development cycles and quicker deployments.
Reliability: Automated testing and monitoring catch bugs early, ensuring stable releases.
Collaboration: Enhanced collaboration between development and operations teams breaks down silos.
Quality: Continuous feedback loops and automation improve the overall quality of the software.
Agility & Flexibility: DevOps enables teams to adapt to changes quickly, maintaining agility in development and operations.
I'm eager to explore these concepts in-depth and see how they transform the way we build and deliver software. Follow along as I continue this journey and share insights, challenges, and successes!
